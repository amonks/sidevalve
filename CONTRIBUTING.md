## how we use issues

If you have a thought, suggestion, question or plan, make an issue. It's fine if issues languish unclosed: if we don't feel like addressing it, it's probably not that important. Make the issue anyway.

If you need someone else to address something, assign them an issue.

If you start working on something, assign your self the issue so other people know not to work on that thing.

If you've addressed whatever an issue covers, close that issue.
