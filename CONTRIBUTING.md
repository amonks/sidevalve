## how we use issues

If you have a thought, suggestion, question or plan, make an issue. It's fine if issues languish unclosed: if we don't feel like addressing it, it's probably not that important. Make the issue anyway.

If you need someone else to address something, assign them an issue.

If you start working on something, assign your self the issue so other people know not to work on that thing.

If you've addressed whatever an issue covers, close that issue.

### labels

* `back-end` `front-end` and `game-end` to tag parts of the codebase
* `question` for stuff that needs further discussion
* `bug` for stuff that is **currently broken** ie crashes the game

### milestones

we use the `SBRBN ADVNTR` milestone to track issues that need to be closed before the *BLGNMN SBRBN ADVNTR* game can come out.

### assignment

Assign yourself issues that you are *currently working on*. Assign other people issues where you *need their involvement*.
